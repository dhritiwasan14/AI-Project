## Project Outline

> The goal of this project is to achieve a positive average score. A positive score implies that the agent has ‘won’ the
game—i.e. Has achieved a score of 21 points. The average score will be calculated by the moving average over
the last 100 episodes and this is done to ensure that the agent’s score is consistent.
